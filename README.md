# LTUAssistant
An AI assistant like Google Now, Siri, Cortana, etc. for an LTU senior project.

This project depends on `espeak` for audio output and
[stanford_corenlp_pywrapper][1].

It currently runs on Ubuntu-based Linux systems, though we would like to
implement cross-platform functionality soon.

The main program is located in `integrated.py` at the moment.
